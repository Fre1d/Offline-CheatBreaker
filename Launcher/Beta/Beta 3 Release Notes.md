**__Beta 3 Release notes:__**

**__Changelog:__**
- Replaced the built in Java with the same Java that was used for CheatBreaker back in 2018 to improve stability.
- Made the GoldenPvP Network logo in the quick connect menu work (not that useful as of now because you still need to select your account ingame).
- The launch button will now say `DOWNLOADING...` after clicking on it.
- Added the servers, settings and about pages

**__What's working__**

- Auto updates for 1.7.10 & 1.8.9.
- Ingame account switcher.
- Playing Multiplayer and Singleplayer.

**__What's partially working__**

**__What's not available__**

- Working RAM slider

**__Notes__**
- This beta doesn't have launcher auto updates. (You'll need to download the second beta manually when it will be released).
- To play you'll need to log into your account in the normal MC launcher or you won't be able to use multiplayer on 1.7.10.
- After launching 1.7.10 you'll need to select your account from the ingame account switcher in the top right corner.
- The max RAM amount is set to 2GB.
- Launching will take longer than in our stable launcher because this launcher re-downloads the client on every launch.
- This launcher uses the normal MC folder so all your Offline CheatBreaker 1.7.10 settings, texture packs, worlds and servers won't be transferred.
- This beta is currently only available for Windows.
- To uninstall this launcher you'll need to open the Windows Control Panel, go to `Uninstall a program` and double click `Offline CheatBreaker Beta`.
