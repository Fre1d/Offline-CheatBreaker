**__Notes__**
- This beta doesn't have launcher auto updates. (You'll need to download the second beta manually when it will be released).
- To play you'll need to log into your account in the normal MC launcher or you won't be able to use multiplayer on 1.7.10.
- After launching 1.7.10 you'll need to select your account from the ingame account switcher in the top right corner.
- The default RAM amount is set to 2GB max.
- Launching will take longer than in our stable launcher because this launcher re-downloads the client on every launch.
- This launcher uses the normal MC folder so all your Offline CheatBreaker 1.7.10 settings, texture packs, worlds and servers won't be transferred.
- This beta is only available for Windows currently.
- To uninstall this launcher you'll need to go to your `%appdata%` folder and delete the `Offline CheatBreaker` folder.
